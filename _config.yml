about_content: |
  I'm passionate about technology, I believe that programming is much more than just writing codes.
  I'm 30 years old, I've been working with technology since I was 16. I have eight years of experience in web development, I graduated in Game Development, post-graduated in Software Engineering, and currently I am taking MBA in Project Management. I seek to see the world differently and solve problems quickly, always seeking to understand the needs of my clients. All the different experiences I had made me the unique professional I am today.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
